             <h2>About Me</h2>
             
             <p> Hello, my name is Miguel Rosado. I am currently enrolled in a full-time bootcamp for programming language.
                 My main programming language is C# (Csharp) but I also know CSS and HTML as well. By the end of my cohert I will end up
                 adding Javascript along with Python to my list of languages. I'm still undecided as to what I may end up doing with these
                 skills. I enjoy playing videogames which could be a great start to a long career but I'm not opposed to new opportunity 
                 anywhere. 
             </p>

             <h2>My Projects</h2>
             <p>Projects of mine consist of mainly console applications at the moment with some ASP.Net6 for an MVC app. With the knowledge I have at the moment I've been able to
                 re-create a couple common programs such as an input game known as FizzBuzz. Another project of mine was Virtual Pet or as the world knows 
                 it, Tamagachi! 
             </p>

                       <p>FizzBuzz is a console app that prints out the numbers 1 through 100. For every multiple of 3 the console prints "Fizz"
                           and for every multiple of 5 the console prints "Buzz". Lastly, for every multiple of 10 the console prints "FizzBuzz!" </p>
